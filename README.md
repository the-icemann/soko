# Soko — Digital Agricultural Marketplace

A production-grade microservices platform connecting Ugandan farmers and buyers. Farmers list produce, buyers place orders, the system handles payments, messaging, and notifications — and a dedicated ML layer delivers personalised recommendations and market price forecasts to every authenticated user.

The platform runs as two independent but integrated Docker Compose stacks:

- **Core stack** — transactional services: auth, users, produce, orders, payments, messaging, notifications, blog, USSD
- **ML stack** — intelligence layer: price prediction, personalised recommendations, market routing, data ingestion, Kafka event backbone

### Key design rules

- Every external request enters through **Nginx only** — core services are never exposed directly on the public network.
- Every call to the ML intelligence layer goes through **ml-gateway-service only** — downstream ML services are internal.
- JWT authentication is enforced at the Nginx gateway via an internal `/_verify_token` subrequest to the auth service. Validated user identity (`X-User-Id`, `X-User-Role`) is injected as headers into every downstream service.
- The recommendation service enforces that a user can only request recommendations for their own account ID — the JWT-derived `X-User-Id` is compared against the path parameter on every request.
- The two stacks communicate over the `soko-ml-bridge` Docker network and the `soko.transactions` Kafka topic.

---

## Core Services

### Auth Service — `:8001`

Issues JWTs on login and validates them on every protected route. Nginx calls `/verify-token` internally — it never reaches the client. On success it injects `X-User-Id`, `X-User-Role`, `X-User-Email` into downstream headers.

**Nginx route:** `/auth/` and `/oauth/` (public)

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/register` | Register with `role: farmer\|buyer\|both` |
| POST | `/auth/login` | Login → `{ access_token, refresh_token }` |
| GET  | `/auth/me` | Current user info (JWT required) |
| POST | `/auth/refresh` | Refresh an expiring token |
| GET  | `/verify-token` | Internal — called by Nginx, not clients |
| GET  | `/verify-token-optional` | Internal — for public routes that optionally expose user context |

---

### User Service — `:8002`

User profiles and account management. Receives authenticated user context from Nginx and never validates tokens itself. Also exposes internal endpoints used by the ML data-ingestion service to bootstrap the feature store.

**Nginx route:** `/users/` (JWT required)

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET  | `/users/me` | JWT | Own profile |
| PUT  | `/users/me` | JWT | Update profile (specialties, interests, district) |
| GET  | `/users/farmers` | JWT | List all farmers (paginated) — also used internally by ML ingestion |
| GET  | `/users/buyers` | JWT | List all buyers (paginated) — also used internally by ML ingestion |
| GET  | `/users/{id}` | JWT | Single farmer profile |

---

### Produce Service — `:8003`

Produce listings — creation, search, and stock management. Farmers create listings; buyers browse them. Supports image uploads via Cloudinary.

**Nginx route:** `/listings/` (JWT optional — public browsing, auth to create)

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST   | `/listings/` | farmer | Create a listing |
| GET    | `/listings/` | optional | Browse / search (filter by category, district, price) |
| GET    | `/listings/{id}` | optional | Single listing |
| PUT    | `/listings/{id}` | farmer | Update own listing |
| DELETE | `/listings/{id}` | farmer | Remove listing |

---

### Order Service — `:8004`

Order lifecycle from placement to completion. Publishes `purchase_completed` events to `soko.transactions` on Kafka on every successful checkout — this is the primary data source for ML price observations and interaction boosts.

**Nginx route:** `/orders/` (JWT required)

**Order state machine:**
```
placed → pending
          ├─► confirmed  (farmer accepts)
          │       └─► completed  (farmer marks done → review unlocked)
          ├─► rejected   (farmer declines)
          └─► cancelled  (buyer withdraws)
```

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST  | `/orders/` | buyer | Place order → publishes to `soko.transactions` |
| GET   | `/orders/` | buyer | List own orders |
| POST  | `/orders/{id}/cancel` | buyer | Cancel → publishes cancellation to Kafka |
| POST  | `/orders/{id}/review` | buyer | Rate after completion |
| GET   | `/orders/incoming/` | farmer | Orders for farmer's produce |
| PATCH | `/orders/{id}/status` | farmer | Advance status |

---

### Payment Service — `:8005`

Payment initiation and reconciliation via PesaPal (MTN Mobile Money / Airtel Money). The `/webhook/` endpoint is public so PesaPal can POST confirmations without a token.

**Nginx routes:** `/payments/` (JWT required) · `/webhook/` (public)

---

### Message Service — `:8006`

Real-time direct messaging over WebSocket. Token is validated by the service itself on WebSocket connection.

**Nginx routes:** `/message/` (JWT required) · `/message/ws/` (WebSocket, service-auth)

---

### Notification Service — `:8007`

Push notifications delivered over WebSocket. Receives events from order and payment services and pushes them to connected clients.

**Nginx routes:** `/notifications/` (JWT required) · `/notifications/ws/` (WebSocket, service-auth)

---

### Blog Service — `:8008`

Agri-knowledge articles and market commentary. Supports image uploads up to 10 MB via Cloudinary.

**Nginx route:** `/posts/` (JWT optional — public reading, auth to create)

---

### USSD Service — `:8009`

USSD session handler for feature-phone users. Allows farmers with basic handsets to check prices and receive order notifications without a smartphone. Calls the ML gateway for price predictions.

**Nginx route:** `/ussd/` (public — USSD networks carry no auth headers)

---

## ML Layer

The ML layer lives in `services/soko-ml/` and runs as a separate Docker Compose stack. All six services connect to the core stack via the `soko-ml-bridge` Docker network.

### ml-gateway-service — host `:8080` / internal `:8000`

Single entry point for all ML capabilities. Nginx proxies `/ml/*` and `/recommendations/*` here. Adds circuit breaking (3 failures → open, 30s reset), request logging, and graceful fallback responses.

| Gateway Endpoint | Routes to | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /price/predict` | price-prediction-service | public |
| `GET /price/markets` | price-prediction-service | public |
| `GET /price/crops` | price-prediction-service | public |
| `GET /recommend/farmers-for-buyer/{buyer_id}` | recommendation-service | JWT required |
| `GET /recommend/buyers-for-farmer/{farmer_id}` | recommendation-service | JWT required |
| `POST /location/route` | location-service | public |
| `POST /location/discover` | location-service | public |
| `GET /gaps/summary` | data-ingestion-service | public |
| `GET /coverage` | data-ingestion-service | public |
| `POST /ingest/bootstrap` | data-ingestion-service | internal |
| `GET /health` | aggregated from all downstream | public |

---

### price-prediction-service — internal `:8001`

Serves 4-week price forecasts per market–crop pair in UGX using pre-trained **Prophet** models.

- Loads `.pkl` model files from `models/` at startup
- Falls back to Uganda bimodal seasonal heuristics when no model file exists
- Caches predictions in Redis (TTL 24 h, key: `price:v1:{market}:{crop}:{weeks}`)
- Consumes `soko.price.requests`; publishes to `soko.price.results`

**Supported markets:** Kisenyi_Kampala · Gulu · Mbarara · Mbale · Lira · Masaka

**Supported crops:** maize_grain · yellow_beans · irish_potatoes · tomatoes · matoke · cassava_chips · sorghum · millet

**Uganda bimodal seasonality factors applied:**
- Jun–Jul, Nov–Dec: ×0.92 (post-harvest abundance)
- Jan–Feb: ×1.10 (lean dry season)

---

### recommendation-service — internal `:8002`

Recommends high-performing farmers to buyers and vice versa using **weighted content-based scoring** enriched in real-time from Kafka interaction events.

- Loads profiles from the ML feature store (PostgreSQL `soko_ml_db`) at startup
- Refreshes profiles every 15 minutes (`PROFILE_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS`)
- Exposes `POST /internal/reload` so data-ingestion can trigger an immediate refresh after bootstrap
- Enforces identity: `x-user-id` from JWT must match the `{buyer_id}` or `{farmer_id}` path parameter
- Caches results in Redis (TTL 1 h)
- Invalidates cache on relevant Kafka interaction events

**Scoring — farmers for buyer:**

| Signal | Weight |
|---|---|
| Crop overlap: buyer interests ∩ farmer specialties / \|buyer interests\| | 0.35 |
| District match (exact) | 0.20 |
| Farmer average rating (normalised / 5.0) | 0.20 |
| Farmer fulfillment rate | 0.15 |
| Interaction boost from `soko.interactions` (capped +0.20) | additive |

**Scoring — buyers for farmer:**

| Signal | Weight |
|---|---|
| Crop overlap: farmer specialties ∩ buyer interests / \|farmer specialties\| | 0.35 |
| District match (exact) | 0.20 |
| Buyer payment reliability | 0.25 |
| Buyer spend volume (normalised by dataset max) | 0.20 |

**Interaction boost values:**

| Event type | Boost |
|---|---|
| `farmer_viewed` | +0.02 |
| `buyer_inquiry` | +0.05 |
| `purchase_completed` | +0.10 |
| `rating_submitted` | +0.04 |
| `high_rating` | +0.08 |

---

### data-ingestion-service — internal `:8004`

Populates and maintains the ML feature store.

**Bootstrap (runs at startup or `POST /bootstrap`):**
1. Fetches all farmer profiles from `GET /users/farmers` on the user service
2. Fetches all buyer profiles from `GET /users/buyers` on the user service
3. Transforms and upserts into `farmer_features` and `buyer_features` tables
4. After bootstrap, immediately calls `POST /internal/reload` on the recommendation service so new users appear in recommendations within seconds rather than waiting for the 15-minute timer

**Streaming:**
- Consumes `soko.transactions` Kafka topic
- Normalises crop names and maps delivery districts to ML market nodes
- Inserts price observations into `price_observations` table
- Detects outliers (rejects prices > 3σ from rolling 30-obs mean)

**Coverage tracking:** Maintains `coverage_map` per (crop, market) pair. When a pair reaches 52 observations, it is flagged as `model_ready`.

---

### location-service — internal `:8003`

Routes farmers to optimal markets and helps buyers discover local supply.

**Tiered routing:**

| Tier | Condition | Response |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Crop supported + ≥52 price observations for market | Top 3 markets ranked by price minus transport cost |
| 2 | Crop supported + <52 observations | Fallback to aggregated cross-market price data |
| 3 | Crop completely unsupported | Publishes `CoverageGapEvent` to `soko.gaps`; returns generic suggestion |

---

### kafka-agent — no HTTP port

Long-running process that bridges the Kafka event stream:

| Consumes | Action |
|---|---|
| `soko.transactions` | Forwards `purchase_completed` events to `soko.interactions` (recommendation boost pipeline) |
| `soko.transactions` | Forwards to data-ingestion via `POST /ingest/order-event` (price observations) |
| `soko.price.requests` | Calls price-prediction-service, publishes result to `soko.price.results` |
| `soko.interactions` | Logged (recommendation-service has its own consumer on this topic) |
| `soko.gaps` | Logs coverage gap events for monitoring |

Failed messages go to `soko.dlq` with full error context for replay.

---

### ML Infrastructure

| Component | Image | Config |
|---|---|---|
| Kafka | `confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.5.0` | 1 broker, auto-topic creation off |
| Zookeeper | `confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:7.5.0` | — |
| Redis | `redis:7-alpine` | 256 MB max, `allkeys-lru` eviction |
| PostgreSQL | `postgres:16-alpine` | `soko_ml_db` database |

**Kafka topics:**

| Topic | Partitions | Retention | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `soko.transactions` | 6 | 7 days | Purchase and order events from order-service |
| `soko.interactions` | 6 | 3 days | Views, inquiries, ratings (recommendation boosts) |
| `soko.price.requests` | 3 | 1 day | Async price prediction requests |
| `soko.price.results` | 3 | 1 day | Async price prediction responses |
| `soko.ml.events` | 2 | 14 days | Model lifecycle events |
| `soko.gaps` | 2 | 30 days | Coverage gap notifications |
| `soko.dlq` | 2 | 30 days | Dead-letter queue |

## Auth → ML: The Authenticated Recommendation Flow

This is the full end-to-end flow for a user receiving personalised recommendations:

```
1. User registers
   POST /auth/register { email, password, role: "buyer" }
   → auth_service creates account + user_service creates profile

2. User updates profile with interests
   PUT /users/me { interests: ["Grains", "Legumes"], district: "Kampala" }
   → user_service stores interests and district

3. ML data-ingestion bootstrap (runs on startup or make ingest-bootstrap)
   data-ingestion-service fetches:
     GET http://user_service:8002/users/farmers  (with X-Internal-Secret)
     GET http://user_service:8002/users/buyers   (with X-Internal-Secret)
   → upserts into farmer_features / buyer_features in soko_ml_db
   → immediately calls POST http://recommendation-service:8002/internal/reload
   → recommendation-service reloads profiles from soko_ml_db within seconds

4. User requests recommendations (authenticated)
   GET /ml/recommend/farmers-for-buyer/{user_id}
       Authorization: Bearer <token>

   Nginx flow:
   a) /_verify_token subrequest → auth_service validates JWT
   b) auth_service returns X-User-Id: {user_id}, X-User-Role: buyer
   c) Nginx injects X-User-Id, X-User-Role and proxies to ml-gateway:8000

   ML gateway flow:
   d) Extracts X-User-Id and X-User-Role from incoming headers
   e) Forwards to recommendation-service:8002/recommend/farmers-for-buyer/{user_id}
      with X-User-Id header attached

   Recommendation service:
   f) Reads X-User-Id header
   g) Validates: X-User-Id MUST equal {buyer_id} path parameter (403 if mismatch)
   h) Looks up buyer profile from in-memory ProfileStore (loaded from soko_ml_db)
   i) Scores all farmers: crop_overlap × 0.35 + district_match × 0.20 +
      avg_rating × 0.20 + fulfillment × 0.15 + interaction_boost (max +0.20)
   j) Returns top N farmers ranked by score, with matchScore field

5. As the user transacts, scores improve automatically
   Order placed → order_service publishes to soko.transactions
   kafka-agent → soko.interactions (purchase_completed event)
   recommendation-service Kafka consumer → interaction_store += +0.10 boost
   → Redis cache invalidated → next request returns re-ranked results
```

## How the Two Stacks Integrate

```
Core stack                              ML stack
──────────────────                      ──────────────────────────────────
order_service:8004  ──Kafka──►          soko.transactions
                                         └── data-ingestion (price obs)
                                         └── kafka-agent → soko.interactions
                                              └── recommendation (boost)

nginx:80  ──proxy──►                    ml-gateway:8000
  /ml/price/     (public)               └── price-prediction-service:8001
  /ml/recommend/ (JWT auth) ──x-user-id──► recommendation-service:8002
  /recommendations/ (JWT auth)

data-ingestion:8004  ──HTTP──►          user_service:8002
                                         GET /users/farmers
                                         GET /users/buyers

ussd_service:8009  ──HTTP──►            ml-gateway:8000
                                         POST /price/predict
```

Both stacks share the `soko-ml-bridge` Docker network. Core service names (`user_service`, `order_service`, `produce_service`) are resolvable from ML services on that bridge.

**Internal secret:** All service-to-service calls use `X-Internal-Secret: internal-secret` (set by `INTERNAL_SECRET` in core services and `INTERNAL_API_KEY` in the ML stack). These must match.

### ML — Price Prediction (public, via Nginx)

```http
POST /ml/price/predict    { "market": "Kisenyi_Kampala", "crop": "maize_grain", "weeks_ahead": 4 }
GET  /ml/price/markets
GET  /ml/price/crops
```

### ML — Recommendations (JWT required, via Nginx)

```http
GET /ml/recommend/farmers-for-buyer/{your_user_id}?top_n=5
    Authorization: Bearer <token>

GET /ml/recommend/buyers-for-farmer/{your_user_id}?top_n=5
    Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The path `{your_user_id}` must be your own user ID from the JWT. The recommendation service returns 403 if you attempt to request another user's recommendations.

### ML — Admin/Internal (bypass Nginx, dev only)

```http
GET  http://localhost:8080/health
POST http://localhost:8096/bootstrap
GET  http://localhost:8096/bootstrap/status
GET  http://localhost:8096/coverage
GET  http://localhost:8096/gaps/summary
POST http://localhost:8095/internal/reload   X-Internal-Secret: internal-secret
```

## Event System (Kafka)

The core stack publishes order events to Kafka. The ML layer consumes them for price learning and recommendation boosting.

### Topics and flows

```
order_service (checkout)
  └── PUBLISH soko.transactions { event_type: "purchase_completed",
                                   buyer_id, farmer_id, crop, market,
                                   quantity_kg, price_per_kg_ugx, total_ugx }

kafka-agent (transaction consumer)
  ├── PUBLISH soko.interactions { event_type: "purchase_completed",
  │                                buyer_id, farmer_id }
  │       └── recommendation-service Kafka consumer applies +0.10 boost

                           crop_submitted, category_guess, priority }
          └── kafka-agent CoverageGapConsumer logs and monitors

Any service
  └── PUBLISH soko.price.requests { market, crop, weeks_ahead }
          └── kafka-agent PriceRequestConsumer calls price-prediction-service

```

### Dead-letter queue

Any message that fails processing after all retries is written to `soko.dlq` with the original topic, raw value, error type, and error message — enabling offline replay and audit.

---

## Getting Started

All commands run from the **project root**. Prerequisites: Docker 20+, Python 3.11+, Make.

### 1. Copy and configure environment files

```bash
cp services/soko-ml/.env.example services/soko-ml/.env
# Edit services/soko-ml/.env — set POSTGRES_PASSWORD and any keys
```

Core service `.env` files are already populated with development defaults in each `services/<name>/.env`.

### 2. Start the core stack

```bash
make core-up
# or: docker compose up --build -d
```

Verify all 9 core services are healthy:
```bash
curl http://localhost/health
```

### 3. Start the ML stack

```bash
make ml-up
# or: cd services/soko-ml && docker compose --env-file .env up --build -d
```

Watch startup logs until all services report healthy:
```bash
make ml-logs
```

### 4. Seed the database with test data

```bash
make seed
```

Registers 13 farmers and 10 buyers via the auth API, updates their profiles (district, specialties, interests), and creates produce listings. After seeding, triggers `make ingest-bootstrap` automatically.

### 5. Bootstrap the ML feature store

```bash
make ingest-bootstrap
```

Pulls all profiles from user-service into `soko_ml_db` and immediately triggers a recommendation-service reload. After this, recommendations are live.

### 6. Verify the full stack

```bash
make health      # Check all ML service health endpoints
make smoke-test  # End-to-end: price prediction + farmer recs + buyer recs
```

### What to look for if something fails

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `"recommendation": "unreachable"` | Feature store empty at startup | Run `make ingest-bootstrap` |
| `"models_loaded": 0"` in price health | No `.pkl` files | Run `make train`, or rely on seasonal fallback |
| Gateway returns `503` | Service startup race | Wait 30 s, check `make ml-logs` |
| `kafka-init` exits immediately | Kafka not ready | It restarts automatically; wait |
| Recommendations return 404 | User not in feature store | Run `make ingest-bootstrap` |
| Recommendations return 403 | JWT user_id ≠ path param | Use your own user ID in the URL |
| `"cached": true` on first call | Stale Redis from prior run | `docker exec soko-ml-redis redis-cli FLUSHDB` |

## Production Bug Report

The following bugs were identified and fixed during the ML integration audit. All fixes are in this codebase.

### SECURITY-01 — `/recommendations/` endpoint bypassed authentication

**Severity:** High  
**Location:** `nginx/nginx.conf`

The legacy `/recommendations/` route proxied to the ML recommendation service without any `auth_request` call. Any unauthenticated client could retrieve another user's personalised recommendations by guessing their UUID.

**Fix:** Added `auth_request /_verify_token` with `X-User-Id` and `X-User-Role` injection, matching the protection on `/ml/recommend/`.

---

### SECURITY-02 — Recommendation service accepted any user ID in path

**Severity:** High  
**Location:** `services/soko-ml/recommendation-service/src/main.py`

The recommendation endpoints accepted `{buyer_id}` and `{farmer_id}` path parameters without checking whether the requesting user was actually that person. An authenticated attacker could harvest recommendations for any user by iterating through UUIDs.

**Fix:** Added `_check_identity()` — reads `x-user-id` header (injected by Nginx from the JWT), compares it against the path parameter, returns 403 on mismatch. Admin role bypasses the check.

---

### SECURITY-03 — ML Gateway did not forward `X-User-Id` to recommendation service

**Severity:** High (prerequisite for SECURITY-02 fix to function)  
**Location:** `services/soko-ml/ml-gateway-service/src/main.py` and `src/proxy.py`

The gateway's `recommend_farmers` and `recommend_buyers` handlers did not accept a `Request` object and therefore could not read or forward the `x-user-id` header injected by Nginx. The recommendation service always received requests with no identity header and therefore could never enforce identity.

**Fix:** Both recommendation handlers now accept `request: Request`, extract `x-user-id` and `x-user-role`, and pass them via the new `headers` parameter on `proxy_request()`.

---

### BUG-01 — Wrong default service ports in data-ingestion clients

**Severity:** High (breaks bootstrap on fresh install)  
**Locations:**
- `services/soko-ml/data-ingestion-service/src/clients/user_client.py` — default `http://user-service:3003` (should be `8002`)
- `services/soko-ml/data-ingestion-service/src/clients/order_client.py` — default `http://order-service:3002` (should be `8004`)

These defaults are only used when the env var is not set. If `.env` is missing or incomplete, bootstrap silently fails — no profiles are ingested, recommendations return empty results.

**Fix:** Corrected both defaults to match the actual service ports.

---

### BUG-02 — Swapped ports in `.env.example` and `docker-compose.yml` defaults

**Severity:** Medium  
**Locations:**
- `services/soko-ml/.env.example` lines 31–32
- `services/soko-ml/docker-compose.yml` data-ingestion environment block

`ORDER_SERVICE_URL` defaulted to port `8003` (produce service port) and `PRODUCE_SERVICE_URL` defaulted to port `8004` (order service port). These were swapped.

**Fix:** Corrected to `ORDER_SERVICE_URL=http://order_service:8004` and `PRODUCE_SERVICE_URL=http://produce_service:8003` in both files.

---

### BUG-03 — Recommendation service missing `POSTGRES_DSN` and `INTERNAL_API_KEY` in docker-compose

**Severity:** High  
**Location:** `services/soko-ml/docker-compose.yml` recommendation-service environment block

The recommendation service loads all profiles from PostgreSQL via `feature_store_client.py`, but `POSTGRES_DSN` was not wired into the container environment. The service would use the hardcoded default DSN string which may not match the actual DB credentials. `INTERNAL_API_KEY` was also missing, meaning the `/internal/reload` endpoint would accept any call without authentication.

**Fix:** Added `POSTGRES_DSN`, `INTERNAL_API_KEY`, `PROFILE_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS` to the recommendation-service environment. Added `soko-ml-db` to its `depends_on`.

---

### BUG-04 — New users waited up to 15 minutes to appear in recommendations

**Severity:** Medium  
**Location:** `services/soko-ml/recommendation-service/src/main.py`

The recommendation service reloads profiles from the ML feature store on a 15-minute timer (`PROFILE_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS=900`). After `make seed` or `POST /bootstrap`, newly registered users would not appear in recommendations for up to 15 minutes.

**Fix:** Added `POST /internal/reload` endpoint to the recommendation service. Data-ingestion now calls this endpoint immediately after each successful bootstrap (both at startup and on manual trigger), reducing the lag from up to 15 minutes to under 10 seconds.

---

### What to watch in production

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| `INTERNAL_SECRET` / `INTERNAL_API_KEY` mismatch | Keep in a shared secrets manager; both must be identical |
| Feature store staleness | Monitor `GET /ingest/bootstrap/status`; set up an alert if `farmers_ingested = 0` |
| Kafka consumer lag | Monitor `soko.transactions` consumer group `soko-ml-price-collector` lag |
| Recommendation cache too aggressive | Tune `REC_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` down if personalisation feels stale |
| Coverage gaps accumulating | Monitor `GET /gaps/summary`; high-frequency gaps signal unmet demand |
| Prophet model staleness | Re-run `make train` as price observations accumulate (>52 per market-crop pair triggers `is_model_ready`) |

---

## Known Limitations

- **Alembic not wired** — schema changes to either stack require dropping the affected DB volume
- **Shared JWT secret** — all core services share one key; use a secrets manager in production
- **Order service `/internal/orders` endpoint not implemented** — data-ingestion bootstrap skips order history and relies on live Kafka streaming for price observations instead; price models need real transaction volume before achieving 52-observation model readiness
- **Interaction boosts are in-memory only** — the `InteractionStore` in the recommendation service is not persisted; a service restart resets all boost scores (they rebuild from `soko.interactions` with `auto.offset.reset=latest`, so only future events contribute)
- **Single Kafka broker** — `KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR=1` is not suitable for production; deploy a 3-broker cluster with replication factor 3
- **No password reset** — requires an outbound email provider
- **Google Maps API optional** — location-service falls back to Haversine straight-line distances when `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is empty; transport cost estimates will be less accurate
